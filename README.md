# Night In The Woods PS VITA

This repo contains patches that you can use in order to get fully working files for my port.

**YOU NEED TO BUY THE GAME ON GOG(version 406) TO MAKE IT WORK!**

NOTICE: OVERCLOCK IS NECESSARY, ONLY WINDOWS VERSION IS SUPPORTED

Known Issues:
- Low Quality/Non Working audio in some scenarios.
- Textures not being displayed properly(misaligned, cut out).
- Improper controller button icons in some places.

# Instructions
First, you might want to install the .VPK using VitaShell. Don't try to launch the game, because it will crash without the neccesary files.

## GOG VERSION
- Download Night In The Woods vpk from vitadb and install it.
- Go to the Release page and download ``NightInTheWoodsVitaGOG.zip``.
- Extract it.
- Put the game's folder(```../GOG/night in the woods/Night in the Woods_Data```) inside the extracted folder(Should be GOG version, make sure there is no Config.ini file in files. if there is one, just delete it.)
- Launch ``ApplyPatch.bat`` and wait(Will need from 15 to 25 minutes depending on the system).
- Let it finish and there should be a .ZIP file named ``NightInTheWoodsVITA.zip``.
- Turn up VitaShell, connect your PS Vita to your PC and copy the contents of the .ZIP file```(Zip file should be around 240MB-250MB before unpacking)``` over to ``ux0:app/NITW22222/`.
- Click on "Replace the files in destination" when it asks you to.
- Launch the game and have fun!
